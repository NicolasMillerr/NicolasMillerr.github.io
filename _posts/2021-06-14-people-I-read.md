# Content Consumption

I think it's importart to consume high quality content. We spend hours a day consuming content on the internet in the form of
youtube videos, blog posts, tweets, etc. Most of that content sucks.

In an attempt be more deliberate about the stuff *I* consume, I'm making a small list of who I enjoy reading / watching and why.

Geohot is probably my favourite person to learn from at the moment. Not so much because he creates particularly educational / useful (to me) content, It's more
of a source of inspiration. Watching someone really smart solve problems makes me want to do the same.
